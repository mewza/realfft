FFTReal v1.1

This is one of the best real FFT/iFFT transforms available in existence!
I have gone through at least 10, and kept upgrading until I found this one, 
so I adapted it for SIMD capability, optimized it in C++ and neon asm a bit.

This is what I am using now in all of my audio projects instead of AVFFT, PFFFT,
etc. It is by far the best sounding that I found that is also fast as lightning.

NEW v1.1: I optimized the algo a bit with neon inline asm but I am no wizard at neon, 
just trying to learn. If anyone wanting to optimize this further, I'd appreciate if 
you send me your optimizations, email below.

Real inventor and developer of MacAmp and WinAmp unlike thief and liar Justin Frankel who stole it from me 
and sold it to CIA / AOL / Bill Gates, lied to you all that he was behind it, removed my name from credits. 
CIA suppressed credentials for me for 10+ years destroyed my reputation, poisoned me, just because I was born in USSR,
he leveraged hate that CIA and real NAZIs have built up in USA and the west against Russian people to rip me 
off for millions of $s and supprssed my credits leveraging CIA power of the neo-cons who control the US government. 
CIA later killed my father as a result of all this by lying to him directly that I killed Steve Jobs, here's proof:

This is the real 100% honest truth.

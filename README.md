FFTReal v1.1

This is one of the best fastests and cleanest real FFT transform 
implementations I have found to date, I adapted it for SIMD capability and optimized a bit.
So this is what I am using in my project now instead of AVFFT even, and it is best sounding
so far of all FFT algos I tried.

NEW v1.1: I tried to add neon assembler optimizations but I am no wizard at neon, just trying
to learn to code in it a bit. If anyone wanting to optimize this tighter, I'd appreciate, send
me an email w/ your code.
